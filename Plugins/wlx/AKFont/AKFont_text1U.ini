Mastery of work comes from diligent application, and success deponds on forethought.
业精于勤，行成于思。
My journey is long and winding, I will keep on exploring my way far and wide.
路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
Treat other people as you hope they will treat you.
己所不欲，勿施于人。
The longest journey begins with the first step.
千里之行，始于足下。
Facts speak plainer than words.
事实胜于雄辩。
